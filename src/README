The code is broken out into subdirectories as follows:

common      -  Independant functions and objects used by the different block
               calculation mechanisms

calc_blocks -  Different functions for calculating a block of primes

prime       -  This coordinates the calculating of blocks in order to generate
               primes over the given range, including coordinating the
               initialisation and the adding of new sieving primes

prog        -  The various compilable programs
